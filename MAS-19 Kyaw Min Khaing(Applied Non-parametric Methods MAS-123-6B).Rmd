You are doing research for an article on the waterfalls on our planet.
You want to make a statement about the heights of waterfalls on three
continents. Three random samples of waterfall heights (in feet) are
shown.

```{r cars}
# Create dataset
waterfall_data <- tibble(
  Continent = rep(c("North America", "Africa", "Asia"), each = 6),
  Height = c(600, 1200, 182, 620, 1170, 442, 
             406, 508, 630, 726, 480, 2014,
             330, 830, 614, 1100, 885, 330)
)
kable(waterfall_data, caption = "Sorted Waterfall Heights")
```

#### (a) What questions are you trying to answer? 
Is there a significant difference in the heights of waterfalls among the
three countries being compared?

#### b) What nonparametric test would you use to find the answer? 

The most appropriate nonparametric test for this scenario is the
Kruskal-Wallis H-test. This test is suitable because it is used to
compare the medians of three or more independent groups when the data
does not meet the assumptions required for parametric tests (such as
normality or equal variances). Since we are comparing the heights of
waterfalls across three countries, the Kruskal-Wallis H-test is the
ideal choice to determine if there are statistically significant
differences in the medians of the groups.Since the data may not be
normally distributed, we use the Kruskal-Wallis test, a nonparametric
alternative to ANOVA.

#### (c) What are the hypotheses?

-   **Null Hypothesis (H0):**: The median waterfall heights are the same
    across all three continents.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):**: At least one continent has a
    different median waterfall height. \## Rank and Tie Case

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
ranked_data <- waterfall_data |> 
  mutate(Rank = rank(Height), 
         Tie_Case = duplicated(Height) | duplicated(Height, fromLast = TRUE)) |> 
  arrange(Rank)

# Display ranked data
kable(ranked_data, caption = "Sorted Waterfall Heights, Ranks, and Tie Cases")
```

####(d) Select a significance level and run the test. What is the H value?
Compute H Statistic Manually

```{r}
# Compute total rank per continent
rank_sums <- ranked_data %>% 
  group_by(Continent) %>% 
  summarise(Rank_Sum = sum(Rank), n = n())
kable(rank_sums, caption = "Rank Sums Calculate H statistic ")
```

Compute H statistic $$
H = \frac{12}{N(N+1)} \sum \frac{R_i^2}{n_i} - 3(N+1)$$

Where: - $N$ is the total number of observations. - $R_i$ is the rank
sum for each group. - $n_i$ is the number of observations in each group.

To Compute the Test Statistic doing Ties Correction (C_H)

The ties correction is applied to adjust for tied ranks. The formula for
the ties correction $C_H$ is:

$$
C_H = 1 - \frac{\sum{(T^3 - Ti)}}{N^3 - N}
$$

Where: - $T$ is the number of tied ranks in each group of ties. - $N$ is
the total number of observations.

```{r}
N <- nrow(ranked_data)
H <- (12 / (N * (N + 1))) * sum((rank_sums$Rj^2) / rank_sums$nj) - 3 * (N + 1)

# Compute tie correction factor
tie_counts <- ranked_data |> count(Rank) |> filter(n > 1) |> pull(n)
C <- 1 - sum(tie_counts^3 - tie_counts) / (N^3 - N)

# Adjust H for ties
H_corrected <- H / C

# Display results
kable(tibble(H_original = H, Tie_Correction = C, H_corrected = H_corrected), 
      caption = "Kruskal-Wallis H Statistic with Tie Correction")
```

Kruskal-Wallis Test Computation

```{r}
# Perform Kruskal-Wallis test
kruskal_result <- kruskal_test(waterfall_data, Height ~ Continent)
p_value <- kruskal_result$p  # p-value ကို ဖတ်ယူပါ

# Display result
kable(kruskal_result, caption = "Kruskal-Wallis Test Results")
```
####(e) What is your conclusion? 
```{r}
p_value <- kruskal_result$p

# Check significance
if (p_value < 0.05) {
  cat("The result is significant (p =", round(p_value, 3), "). There is evidence that at least one continent has a different median waterfall height.\n")
} else {
  cat("The result is not significant (p =", round(p_value, 3), "). We do not have enough evidence to conclude that waterfall heights differ by continent.\n")
}
```

# 3(a)

As a biologist, you wish to see if there is a relationship between the
heights of tall trees and their diameters. You find the following data
for the diameter (in inches) of the tree at 4.5 feet from the ground and
the corresponding heights (in feet).
#### What question are you trying to answer? 
(i) Research Question Is there a relationship between the diameter of a tree and its height?
#### What type of nonparametric analysis could be used to answer the question? 
(ii) Nonparametric Test Selection To analyze the relationship between
     the two continuous variables (tree diameter and tree height), the
     Spearman’s rank correlation test is the most appropriate
     nonparametric method. This test is used to assess the strength and
     direction of the association between two variables when the data
     does not meet the assumptions of parametric tests (such as
     normality or linearity). Spearman’s rank correlation is
     particularly useful for ordinal data or when the relationship
     between variables is monotonic but not necessarily linear.
####  Is there a relationship between the two at the 0.05 level of significance?
(iii)
-   **Null Hypothesis (H0):**: There is no monotonic relationship
          between tree diameter and height. (𝜌=0

-   **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):**: There is a significant monotonic
    relationship between tree diameter and height. (𝜌≠0)


```{r}
# Create dataset
tree_data <- tibble(
  Diameter = c(1024, 950, 451, 505, 761, 644, 707, 586, 442, 546),
  Height = c(261, 321, 219, 281, 159, 83, 191, 141, 232, 108)
)

Rank transformation and check for ties

```{r}

  mutate(Rank_Diameter = rank(Diameter), 
         Rank_Height = rank(Height), 
         Tie_Case_Diameter = duplicated(Diameter) | duplicated(Diameter, fromLast = TRUE),
         Tie_Case_Height = duplicated(Height) | duplicated(Height, fromLast = TRUE)) |>

 Conclusion

```{r}
if (spearman_result$p < 0.05) {
  cat("The result is significant (p < 0.05). There is evidence of a monotonic relationship between tree diameter and height.\n")
} else {

# 3(b)

A study is conducted to determine whether there is a correlation between
handedness and eye-hand coordination. Five right-handed and five
left-handed subjects are administered a test of eye-hand coordination.
The test scores of the subjects follow (the higher a subject’s score,
the better his or her eye-hand coordination). Is there a statistical
relationship between handedness and eye hand coordination?

```{r}
# Create dataset
data <- tibble(
  Subject = 1:10,
  Handedness = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),  # Right-handed = 1, Left-handed = 0
  Coordination_Score = c(11, 1, 0, 2, 0, 11, 11, 5, 8, 4)  # Higher = better coordination
)

# Display data
kable(data, caption = "Dataset: Handedness and Eye-Hand Coordination Scores")
```

(i) Research Question Is there a significant relationship between
    handedness (X: Right-handed = 1, Left-handed = 0) and eye-hand
    coordination scores (Y: Higher score = better coordination)?
(ii) Nonparametric Test Selection Since X is binary (categorical) and Y
     is continuous, the Point-Biserial Correlation is the appropriate
     statistical test.
(iii) Hypotheses Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no correlation between
      handedness and eye-hand coordination. (𝑟𝑝𝑏=0) Alternative
      Hypothesis (H₁): There is a significant correlation between
      handedness and eye-hand coordination. (𝑟𝑝𝑏≠0)

A researcher conducts a study in order to evaluate the effect of noise
on altruistic behavior. Each of the 12 subjects who participate in the
experiment is randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions.
Subjects in both conditions are given a one-hour test which is
ostensibly a measure of intelligence. During the test the six subjects
in Group 1 are exposed to continual loud noise, which they are told is
due to a malfunctioning generator. The six subjects in Group 2 are not
exposed to any noise during the test. Upon completion of this stage of
the experiment, each subject on leaving the room is confronted by a
middle-aged man whose arm is in a sling. The man asks the subject if she
would be willing to help him carry a heavy package to his car. In
actuality, the man requesting help is an experimental confederate (i.e.,
working for the experimenter). The number of subjects in each group who
help the man is recorded. One of the six subjects who were exposed to
noise elects to help the man, while five of the six subjects who were
not exposed to noise elect to help the man. Do the data indicate that
altruistic behavior is influenced by noise?

## Fisher's Exact Test for Noise Effect on Altruistic Behavior
