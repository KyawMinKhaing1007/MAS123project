```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse,knitr)
```

## **1. State the Hypotheses**
### **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**:  
There is no association between variables A and B (they are independent).  

### **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**:  
There is a significant association between variables A and B (they are dependent).  

## **2. Create and Load the Dataset**
```{r}
# Create observed frequency table
dataset <- tibble(
  B = rep(c("B1", "B2"), each = 2),
  A = rep(c("A1", "A2"), times = 2),
  Observed = c(15, 25, 20, 30)
)
# Print observed dataset
  kable(dataset, caption = "observed frequency")
```
## **3. Compute Expected Frequencies**

```{r cars}
# Compute row and column totals
total_count <- sum(dataset$Observed)
row_totals <- dataset %>% group_by(B) %>% summarise(Row_Sum = sum(Observed))
col_totals <- dataset %>% group_by(A) %>% summarise(Col_Sum = sum(Observed))

# Merge row and column totals with dataset
expected_data <- dataset %>%
  left_join(row_totals, by = "B") %>%
  left_join(col_totals, by = "A") %>%
  mutate(Expected = (Row_Sum * Col_Sum) / total_count)

# Print expected dataset
kable(expected_data, caption = "expected frequency")
```
## **4. Compute Chi-Square Test Statistic**

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# Compute Chi-Square statistic manually
expected_data <- expected_data %>%
  mutate(Chi_Square_Components = (Observed - Expected)^2 / Expected)
kable(expected_data, caption = "Chi_Square_Components")
```

```{r}
chi_sq_stat <- sum(expected_data$Chi_Square_Components)
# Degrees of freedom
df <- (length(unique(dataset$B)) - 1) * (length(unique(dataset$A)) - 1)

# Compute p-value
p_value <- pchisq(chi_sq_stat, df, lower.tail = FALSE)

# Print results
cat("Chi-Square Statistic:", round(chi_sq_stat, 4), "\n")
cat("Degrees of Freedom:", df, "\n")
cat("p-value:", round(p_value, 4), "\n")
```
## **5. Interpretation**
```{r}
if (p_value < 0.05) {
  cat("Since p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.\n")
  cat("There is a significant association between A and B.\n")
} else {
  cat("Since p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n")
  cat("There is no significant association between A and B.\n")
}
```
