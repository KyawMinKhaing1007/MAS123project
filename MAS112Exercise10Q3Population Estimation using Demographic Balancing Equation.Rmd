```

Step 4: Create a Tibble Table

```{r cars}
# Create a tibble with the computed values
population_data <- tibble(
  Year = c("2005", "2010"),
  Population = c(45486000, 45510226),
  Births = c(34570, NA),
  Deaths = c(13674, NA),
  In_Migrants = c(5675, NA),
  Out_Migrants = c(2345, NA),
  Natural_Increase = c(20896, NA),
  Net_Migration = c(3330, NA),
  Net_Population_Increase = c(20896 + 3330, NA)
)

# Display the tibble
population_data %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

## **Conclusion**

-   The **natural increase** was **20,896**.

-   The **net migration** was **3,330**.

-   The **net population increase** was **24,226**.

-   The **estimated population for 2010** was **45,510,226**.
